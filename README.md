# Pytorchlearning
Using this repo to save my code in the clouds. I am running this locally on my machine(s) and most tutorials have a cloud environement, I just like to setup my own things.


Day 1: Managed to learn how to manipulate tensors.

Day 2: Even more tensor methods + datatypes learned.

Day 3: Matrix multiplication, nothing new here to be honest.

Day 4: Even more tensor manipulations: squeezing, unsqueezing, viewing and reshaping.

Week 2: Had to go back and revise tensors again before making an advancement.

I do not know in which timeline I am as we speak, I can find it if I want to but: As of yet, I can build a model and make predictions.
